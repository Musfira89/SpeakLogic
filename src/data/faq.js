      question: "What is The Speak Logic Project?",
      answer:
        "The Speak Logic Project was started to promote better communication. The Speak Logic Project is a non-profit organization that promotes better communication. To learn more about The Speak Logic Project and how The Speak Logic Project promotes better communication, you can click in this link.",

    {
      question: "Why does The Speak Logic Project exist?",
      answer:
        "The importance of communication cannot be disregarded in life. Since everything that we do is driven by communication, when we commit error in communication, there is a chance that the error leads us to make mistakes in what we do. With that, we can see there is a need for better communication. The Speak Logic Project exists to promote better communication by helping people communicate without error.",

      question: "What is communication?",
      answer:
        "Rather than answering this question as it is asked, it is better to substitute it to another question. For instance, what is the importance of communication? Is communication important? Since communication is the driving force of everything that we do, we can see that communication is very important within what we do. We can also say that communication is very important in life.",

      question: "Why promote better communication?",
      answer:
        "To understand the importance of communication it is worthwhile to look at the relationship of communication related to what we do. With that, we can look at the relationship of errors that we make in our communications related to problems that we develop in life. To answer this question, see chapter 2 and chapter 3 of Understanding The Principle of Communication for more information.",

      answer:
        "In order to get started, you can do the following:\n\n- Download the books\n- Read the books\n- Do the exercises\n- Participate in the forum\n- Perform analysis of communications that need to be analyzed\n- Refer others to the website or help others to be aware of The Speak Logic Project",

      question:
        "Can we solve problems that we develop without proper communication?",
      answer:
        "See Understanding The Principle of Communication chapter 3 to answer this question.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why proper communication is important?",
      answer:
        "Since a function that we execute is related to our communication, the execution of that function is simply driven by our communication. In this case, if we commit error in the communication that drives the function, the function will also execute with error. If we can identify error in the communication that drives the function and get it corrected, then the function can be executed without error. Since communication drives our functions and proper communications enable us to execute our functions without error, thus proper communication is very important to us.",

      question: "How can I help The Speak Logic Project?",
      answer:
        "By helping The Speak Logic Project, you are also promoting proper communication. By promoting proper communication, you are also helping in solving problems that are caused by improper communications. There are several ways you can help The Speak Logic Project. You can help the project in other means. For instance, you can help Speak Logic in term of promoting better communication by making other people aware of the project. You can click here to go to the help page for more information.",

      question:
        "Why it is important for Speak Logic to be present at other locations? Why it is important for Speak Logic to be present at my location?",
      answer:
        "To better answer this question, let's take it this way. Between you and me, the only interface that exists between us is the communication interface. While you can be at location A and I can be at location B, but the communication interface that exists between us enables us to communicate together. Since that communication interface is a part of us, in order for us to understand it, we have to understand the principle of communication (see Principle of Communication exercise 789 for more information). It is not possible for us to understand our communication interface without understanding the principle of communication. By understanding the principle of communication, we know that communication is the only entity that connects us together. In this case, while many of us can be in separate countries or locations, but with that communication interface, we are able to communicate together. Now since our misunderstanding of the principle enables us to misunderstand our communication interface (for instance by understanding the principle of communication, we know that we can use our communication interface to work together and solve problems, but when we misunderstand our communication interface, we think that we can solve problems without the use of communication), in order for us to understand our communication interface we have to understand the principle of communication. To facilitate us with the understanding of the principle of communication, it makes sense for The Speak Logic Project to be present at our current locations. In other words, to enable the learning and the understanding of the principle of communication, it makes sense for The Speak Logic Project to be present at my location. With the presence of The Speak Logic Project at our locations, that provides us the opportunity of learning and understanding the principle of communication and use our communication interface to solve identified problems.",

      question:
        "What is the difference between learning the principle with the help of an instructor or with the help of a book?",
      answer:
        "To better answer this question, let's take it like this. Since the instructors must undergo the same learning process as the students, it is assumed that the instructors have learned the principle already. Since the instructors have already learned the principle and they are the instructors, then it is possible for the instructors to help students and others with the learning of the principle (see Principle of Communication exercises 384 and 385 for more information). Now in term of leaning of the principle from a book and the learning of the principle from an instructor, it is always good for us to think it in terms of the way the student views the principle and the way the instructor views the same principle. Since the instructor has learned the principle already, in this case the instructor views the principle as the principle. Since the student has not learned the principle already, in this case the student may view the book as the principle (see Principle of Communication exercise 628 for more information). Given that the principle is not a physical entity and cannot be represented by a book, then by viewing the principle as a book that may provide difficulty for the student in the learning of the principle. For this reason, it is always better for the student to learn the principle with the help of an instructor instead.",

      question:
        "If The Speak Logic Project achieves its goal, will it still be necessary?",
      answer:
        "The Speak Logic Project exists only to solve a problem and that problem is the learning and the understanding of the principle of communication. If at a certain time that problem has been solved, then there is no need for the project to exist. Once the problem that needs to be solved is solved, then the project will cease to exist. Since at that time the existence of the project is no longer needed, then the project itself will no longer be needed.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Can you clarify more on the purpose and lifespan of The Speak Logic Project?",
      answer:
        "To better answer this question, we have to look at what we do in term of stability. Even the learning process of a given principle takes stability into consideration. There is no such thing as an infinite process. The learning process of a given principle cannot go to infinity, at some point of time the underlying principle has to be learned. Given that in order to have stability the functional system has to be stable, the functional system does not allow a process we add to it to be infinite. To further answer this question, see Fundamental of Communication appendix D Our System Functionality Related to Stability and Fundamental of Communication exercises 673, 673’, 748, 748’, 762, 762’, 816, 816’ and 879, 879’ for more information.",
